## Introduction

Azrieli Students On Software Modeling and Architecture is a collection of modeling and architectural descriptions of open source software systems written by students from Azrieli - Jerusalem College of Engineering during a master level [course][sw-modeling-2016b] taking place in 2016.

[sw-modeling-2016b]: https://github.com/jce-il/sw-modeling-2016b

Teams of students could adopt a project of choice on GitHub. The projects selected had to be sufficiently complex and actively maintained.

Inspired by Brown and Wilsons' [Architecture of Open Source Applications][aosa], and the [desosa] book, each description appears as a chapter, resulting in the present online book.
